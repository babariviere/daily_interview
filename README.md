# DailyInterview

A set of exercises from [Daily Interview Pro](https://www.techseries.dev/daily)
and resolved in Elixir. This repository only exists to keep a trace of my
learning experience with Elixir.

## Project Structure

For now, it's a bit dirty. This section will be written when the code will be clean.

## Usage

You can build everything by running:

```sh
mix deps.get
mix compile
```

This creates no output because it's a library.
But you can test if my functions works by running:

```sh
mix test
```

## TODO

- [x] longest substring without repeating characters
- [ ] palindrome
- [x] balanced parentheses
- [x] first and last indices
- [x] reverse linked list
